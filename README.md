1. Move Label properties to App.axaml file resources-Done,
2. Move logic to rewrite labels in selected language when static (global) event for language is triggered to view classes-Done
3. Implement missing logic for character resource points (Strenght, Soul, Influence) and also implement it visualy in view class-3 states=not used resource/used resource/scarred resource-implement by checkbox/label/other elements ?
4. Implement logic for "scarred" resources (probably just TextBox element with variable length)
5. Create save player characters by serialization
6. Implement other models (like inventory model-here try classic inventory, not just TextBox element)
7. Move from serialization to Entity Framework-local (later global maybe ?) database
8. (Optional)-solve problems in app designer when using dependency injection
